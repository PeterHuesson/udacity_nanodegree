## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

Will making your hobby to your job make you rich? A comparison between Hobbyists and no Hobbyists

- Are people who program in their free time more satisfied in their job?
- Do developers who program also as a hobby make more money?
- Will this additional training and expertise pay off in the long run?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available [here](https://github.com/m444x/StackOverflow-Survey-2019/blob/master/Stack%20Overflow%20Survey.ipynb) to showcase work related to the questions above.  In this notebook I go through the stack overflow survey data and answer the questions above.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://toDo).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stack Overflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
